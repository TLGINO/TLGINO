# Hi, I'm Martin!

A little bit about me:

I'm a student at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, originally from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.

I have previously worked at Amazon Luxembourg as a Business Intelligence Engineer and [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/) as a Software Engineer, where I worked on the development of [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/).


When I have time I also work on some UNI / personal projects - check out my repos!
