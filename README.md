# Hi, I'm Martin!

A little bit about me:

I"m a student currently working at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/) as a Software Engineer, all while studying at [UniversitÃ  della Svizzera Italiana](https://www.usi.ch/en) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, originally from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.



I'm currently working on the development of [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/), but also some UNI / personal projects, notably a mobile app [Patchify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TLgino.gameupdatenotifier&hl=en_US&gl=US).
